## üåü Features

- **Real-time ping monitoring** to a specified host (default: google.com)
- **Discord notifications** when ping exceeds the threshold
- **Custom status** on your Discord bot showing your current ping condition
- **Configurable thresholds** to match your needs
- **Robust error handling** to prevent crashes
- **User-friendly** setup and startup scripts with batch files

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.11+ (recommended)
- Discord bot token and permissions
- Internet connection 



## üöÄ Installation

1. Download [**LATEST RELEASE**](https://github.com/bebe-Kexe/ping-monitor-x-discord/releases) zip (always called after the version)
   - Unzip it into your desired directory

3. Install dependencies:
   - Open the ``ping-monitor-x-discord`` folder
   - Simply double-click ``setup.bat``

## üíª Usage

Run the script with:

- Double-click ``start.bat``
   - If this is your first time running it, a ``.env_vars`` file will be created. Open it with a text editor and specify ``DISCORD_TOKEN``, ``CHANNEL_ID``, and ``USER_NAME`` (optional).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the following variables in .env_vars to customize your experience:

```.env_vars
DISCORD_TOKEN=xxx.yyy.zzz  # Replace with bot token
CHANNEL_ID=1234567890      # Replace with channel ID
USER_NAME=@xxxxxx          # Replace with your username (optional)
HOST_TO_PING=google.com  # The host to monitor
PING_INTERVAL=5            # Check interval in seconds
PING_THRESHOLD=120         # Alert threshold in milliseconds (ms)
```

The program will:
1. Connect to Discord using your bot token
2. Start monitoring ping to the specified host
3. Send notifications when ping exceeds your threshold
4. Update the bot's status to reflect current ping conditions 



## üîÆ Future Goals
Planned features and improvements for upcoming releases:

- [x] More user friendly setup and startup
- [x] Bot mentions discord user in high ping alert message
- [ ] Bot counts how long did it took for ping to settle 
- [ ] **Split Bulk Delete and Individual Delete**: Implement a two-phase message deletion system that:
      - First identifies messages newer than 14 days and deletes them in bulk (fast)
      - Then handles older messages individually with proper rate limiting (slower)
      - Provides real-time progress feedback to users during deletion
      - Allows cancelling long-running deletion operations
- [ ] Docker container support  
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows)
- [ ] Bot sends high ping message to multiple channels
